    "# Short Description\n",
    "\n",
    "    This experiment involves taken into different \"Sunny Solar Profiles\" of each grid at different instances of time.\n",
    "    Each grid at no time recieves the same amount of Solar Energy to the pre installed solar panels. If a grid, like maybe a village\n",
    "    which gets access to higher solar energy levels as compared to any big city. The village can act as a power plant/energy supplier\n",
    "    for satisying the city demands at a slightly low cost. This could be done by utlising the storage facility on D3A simulation and\n",
    "    calculating different demands of the city and if they could be satisfied by another grid. This would help the village growing faster\n",
    "    as a community and build a future for the people in that grid. High cost can be beared by the city grid due to the need because of\n",
    "    corporate companies mainly building the headquarters at such a location which gives them maximum profits. Note that the supplier\n",
    "    grid should only provide for the peak hours, like 9-5pm .\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As such, D3A would automatically get its core customer base and grow from there on. This experiment involves both City and Village grid\n",
    "    thus ensuring equal promotion in both aspects. Since village grids do not have higher energy requirements and city grid now much more\n",
    "    dependant on village grids, Power plants will be more or less forced to lower the cost units of the energy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is my experiment and even though it is a crude idea, I think its worth believing in."

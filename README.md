# Model-Templates
This Project serves to be a one stop shop for people looking into readymade templates of different machine and deep learning models.
It contains most used supervised as well as unsupervised models which are ready for use.
It is highly recommended to use Spyder or other IDE except Jupyter Notebook for models with a high load of Datasets.
